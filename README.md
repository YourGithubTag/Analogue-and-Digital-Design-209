# Analogue and Digital Design 209
This code base was used to program an Atmel ATmega to be able to sense current, voltage and real power on a prototype multimeter that my team and I were working on.
The code is not very portable, with many macros being specific to the Atmel chip we were using. The use of interfaces was discussed, however was far outside of the scope
of this course. This was a great software / hardware design project which I thoroughly enjoyed, and my teams design was selected to be in the finals to be judged by two
judges from DataMars
